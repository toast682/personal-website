I am a current 4th year computer science student at the University of British Columbia. I have previously worked at Amazon Web Services as a Software Development Engineering Intern on the AWS IoT Greengrass team, and at Safe Software as a Software Development Intern. I have also completed a reaseach assistant position at the University of British Columbia within the Department of Statistics! I am interested in many areas of software development, such as full stack development, mobile development, and data analysis. Outside of work you can find me playing tennis, basketball, and video games!
